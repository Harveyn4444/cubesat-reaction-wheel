# Hardware

The hardware section is a combination of 3D printer files, PCB schematics and production files.

The structure was custom made and can be reproduced using the stl files provided with recommended slicer parameters.

The custom PCB can be assembled with the production files and the Bill of Materials provided.

## [Structure](https://github.com/Harveyn4444/cubesat-reaction-wheel/tree/main/hardware/structure)

### STL files
These files are used to 3D print the model. You will need slicer software to create the files that the printer can use. Some examples are CURA(Most printers) and Prusaslice (For Prusa printers like I used).

### .f3d files
These files are used to export the model into fusion360 to modify. 

## [PCB]
A custom PCB was created to contain the electronics and sensors for the CubeSat. This keeps everything neat and tidy and makes testing and operation much easier.

### Gerber files
Gerber files are used to produce the actual PCBs. To design the schematics and PCBs I used [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) where you can export the gerber files for production. To manufacture the PCBs I used [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), which provide a high quality product at a very low cost (Use the cheapest shipping method that takes 2 weeks!). 

## [Bill of Materials]
A BOM is included as not everything can be 3D printed. The exta hardware used will include links but anything similar shoudl work (Plus links could expire).
