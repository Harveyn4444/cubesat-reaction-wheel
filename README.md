The goal of the project was to create a CubeSat Reaction Wheel contained within 1U primarily using COTS components and open source solutions.

##  Hardware
The hardware section is a combination of 3D printer files, PCB schematics and production files.

The structure was cusotm made and can be reproduced using the stl files provided with recommended slicer parameters. 

The custom PCB can be assembled with the production files and the Bill of Materials provided.


## Code

### Arduino / Microcontroller
Example test code for the sensors used and example code to control the BLDC motor.

### Plotting
Code included to read and log serial data output and save this data and plot it.
